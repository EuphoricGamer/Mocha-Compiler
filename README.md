# Mocha-Compiler
A lexer/parser/compiler for a C like language, written in Java for an interpreted language written in C++ (still in the works)

This is an old projects, one of my first attempts at a lexer/parser, it's not very clean because there's a lot of test code but it outputs
op code just fine.

The opcode can be used executed in an interpreter that was written in c++ ( will upload later ).
